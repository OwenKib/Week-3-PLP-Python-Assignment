# Discount Price Calculator

A simple Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## Features

*   **Function-based calculation:** The core logic is encapsulated in a reusable `calculate_discount` function.
*   **Conditional discounts:** A discount of 20% or more is applied, otherwise, the original price is returned.
*   **User-friendly interface:** The script prompts the user for the price and discount percentage and handles potential invalid inputs gracefully.

## How to use

1.  **Run the script:** Execute the Python script from your terminal.
    ```sh
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
2.  **Enter details:** Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the original price and the discount percentage.
3.  **View the result:** The script will print the final price, indicating whether a discount was applied.
